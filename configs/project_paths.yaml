# SAN_Project Directory Configuration
# Purpose:
# Centralized configuration for file paths used throughout the project.
# This keeps all data, models, and logs in a consistent structure.

paths:
  raw_data: datasets/raw               # Original unmodified datasets (e.g., COCO, SUN RGB-D)
  processed_data: datasets/processed   # Cleaned or augmented datasets
  yolo_ready: datasets/yolo_ready      # Training-ready YOLO data (images + labels)
  models: models                       # Folder to save trained or fine-tuned models
  results: results                     # All inference outputs and evaluation results
  logs: results/logs                   # Text-based logs for debugging and training records
  detections: results/detections       # YOLOv8 output predictions (images, JSON, etc.)
  configs: configs                     # All configuration files (like this one)
  docs: docs                           # Documentation, diagrams, and markdown reports
